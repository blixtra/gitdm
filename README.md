Please use `*.sh` scripts to run analytics (`all*.sh` for full analysis and `rels*.sh` for per release stats)
This program assumes that gitdm lives in: `~/dev/cncf/gitdm/` and kubernetes in `~/dev/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/`
Output files are placed in `kubernetes/` directory.

This is an iterational process:
Run any of scripts. Review its output in kubernetes directory. Iteratively adjust mappings to handle more authors (config/mappings is in
`cncf-config/`)

You can also run via `./debug.sh` to halt in debugger and review hackers structure and those who were not found. See `cncfdm.py`:`DebugUnknowns`

# Contributing

Pull Request are welcome.
Our mapping is not complete, please see config files in: https://github.com/cncf/gitdm/blob/master/cncf-config/.

File https://github.com/cncf/gitdm/blob/master/cncf-config/email-map is a direct mapping email to employer.

There is also a long list of unknown emails, please see section `Developers with unknown affiliation`:
https://github.com/cncf/gitdm/blob/master/results.txt

All unknown developers have 4 or less contribution.
Current list of unknown developers (names & emails): https://github.com/cncf/gitdm/blob/master/unknown_devs.txt

# Detailed description:

Use `./rerun_data.sh` to regenerate all data which means:
- Data for `kubernetes/kubernetes` repository (all time) with 3 mappings of Unknown developers: no mapping (list them with their email & name), map them to theirs email domain's (`user@gmail.com` --> `'Gmail *'`), map all of them to '(Unknown)'. This is done via running: (`./all.sh`, `./all_no_map.sh`, `./all_with_map.sh`). Output comes to `./kubernetes/all_time/` directory
- Data for `kubernetes/kubernetes` repository divided into releases v1.0.0, v1.1.0, ..., v1.6.0 (with 3 types of mappings described above). This is done with (`./rels.sh`, `./rels_strict.sh`, `./rels_no_map.sh`). Output comes to ./kubernetes/v1.X.0-v1.Y.0/` directory: X=0,1,2,3,4,5, Y=1,2,3,4,5,6)
- Data for all 90 (currently) repos that makes entire Kubernetes project with `./all_multirepos.sh` script. It will be descibed later.
- Final files generated by first 2calls (for single repo kubernetes/kubernetes) are in `./kubernetes/all_time/*.txt` and `./kubernetes/v1.X.0-v1.Y.0/*.txt`

All of them use `git log` call with specific args piped to `cncfdm.py` call with specific parameters. See `./run.sh` for example, all other calls use the same commands `git log` and `cncfdm.py` with other parameters.
To see parameters for `cncfdm.py` see comments inside `cncfdm.py` file describing all possible options. For more details about how `cncfdm.py` tool works refer to its sources and other `*.py` files.
